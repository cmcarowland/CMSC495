# Chapter 2: Software Project Planning

- Urgency motivates software projects but can also cause problems if it leads to rushed decisions or overlooked requirements.
- Stakeholders, software engineers, and management are all affected by project urgency, but must avoid losing sight of the actual needs.
- Focusing only on urgency can result in solving the wrong problems or missing the big picture.
- Successful project planning requires everyone to understand and agree on why and how the software will be built before starting work.

## Understand the Project Needs
- Stakeholders may request early versions or prototypes to confirm their needs are understood, not to see technical details.
- Miscommunication between stakeholders and engineers can lead to frustration and project failure.
- Good project management involves identifying decision-makers and documenting their needs to set the project on the right course.

## Drive the Scope of the Project
- The project manager is responsible for defining the scope at the start of the project.
- Defining scope before other activities prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment.
- Writing a vision and scope document helps capture knowledge and set direction.
- Early project decisions are critical; misunderstandings at this stage can derail the project.

## Talk to the Main Stakeholder
- The project manager must identify and build relationships with the main stakeholders.
- Understanding stakeholder needs is key to delivering tailored software solutions.
- Stakeholders should see the project manager as their main contact for issues and changes.
- Goodwill can be established through early meetings and by documenting stakeholder needs.

## Write the Vision and Scope Document
- The vision and scope document is essential for avoiding costly miscommunication and scope problems.
- It ensures all stakeholders and engineers share a common understanding of project goals and scope.
- The document should be created before coding begins, but can also help rescue troubled projects.
- The project manager should use the document to build consensus and unify the team.

### Vision and Scope Document Outline
- **Problem Statement**: Summary of the problem the project will solve.
- **Project Background**: History and justification for the project.
- **Stakeholders**: List and description of stakeholders and their needs.
- **Users**: List and description of users and their needs.
- **Risks**: Potential risks identified by the team.
- **Assumptions**: List of assumptions made by stakeholders, users, or the team.
- **Vision of the Solution**:
    - Vision statement: Describes the project's purpose and goals.
    - List of features: Key features to be developed, each with a brief description.
    - Scope of phased release (optional): Plan for phased releases if needed.
    - Features that will not be developed: Explicitly excluded features and reasons.

- The outline serves as a guide for stakeholder discussions and consensus-building.
- The document is a record of the vision and scope discussion, not just a bureaucratic exercise.

## Review the Vision and Scope Document
- The document should be reviewed by all stakeholders, team members, and users.
- The project manager must follow up on feedback and ensure consensus.
- A complete, agreed-upon document unifies the team and enables effective project planning.

# Chapter 2: How to Work Well on Teams

- Software development is a team effort; success depends on humility, respect, and trust among team members.
- Self-awareness is crucial: understand your own behaviors and attitudes before judging others.
- Insecurity is common among programmers and can lead to hiding work or fearing criticism.
- The "Genius Myth"—idolizing individuals for team achievements—overlooks the importance of collaboration.
- Most successful software projects are the result of teamwork, not solo genius.
- Hiding your work is risky; early sharing and collaboration help detect mistakes and improve outcomes.
- The "bus factor" measures how many people need to leave before a project fails; sharing knowledge increases project resilience.
- Working alone slows progress and limits learning; teams move faster and benefit from collective wisdom.
- Feedback loops, both in coding and project management, are essential for rapid improvement and adaptation.
- Office environments should balance collaboration and focus; small teams in shared spaces work best.
- Avoid working in isolation—collaboration reduces risk and increases productivity.
- High-functioning teams are key to success; the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

## The Three Pillars of Social Interaction
- **Humility**: Recognize you are not infallible and be open to self-improvement.
- **Respect**: Value and appreciate your coworkers' abilities and contributions.
- **Trust**: Believe in your teammates' competence and let them take the lead when appropriate.
- Most social conflicts can be traced to a lack of humility, respect, or trust.

## Why These Pillars Matter
- Building relationships and understanding personalities improves productivity and teamwork.
- Social skills are as important as technical skills for long-term success.
- Relationships outlast projects and help get things done.

## Humility, Respect, and Trust in Practice
- Lose the ego; focus on team accomplishments rather than personal glory.
- Give and receive criticism constructively; separate feedback on work from personal attacks.
- Accept failure as part of innovation; learn from mistakes through blameless postmortems.
- Be patient and flexible when collaborating with different working styles.
- Be open to influence and willing to change your mind when presented with new evidence.
- Vulnerability and admitting mistakes build trust and respect within teams.

## "Googleyness" and Team Culture
- Google defines "Googleyness" as thriving in ambiguity, valuing feedback, challenging the status quo, putting users first, caring about the team, and doing the right thing.
- These behaviors exemplify humility, respect, and trust.
- Explicitly defining cultural expectations helps avoid bias and build strong teams.

## Conclusion
- Well-functioning teams are the foundation of successful software projects.
- The Genius Myth is misleading; lasting success comes from healthy team culture rooted in humility, trust, and respect.
- Creative software development requires risk-taking and acceptance of failure, supported by a strong team environment.

**TL;DRs**
- Working in isolation has trade-offs; collaboration is usually more productive.
- Invest in understanding personalities and working styles to improve team productivity.
- Know your own and others' preferred working styles for effective teamwork.
